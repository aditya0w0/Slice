Guidelines

- Documentation is manual: the assistant will append entries to `changelogs/` and update top-level `CHANGELOG.md` when it makes code changes.
- Each session entry contains:
    - A short summary
    - Files changed
    - Why the change was made
    - Verification steps (commands or pages to visit)
